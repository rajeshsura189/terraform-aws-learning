# Terraform from Scratch

Welcome to the Terraform from Scratch repository! In this repository, we will learn about Terraform, an open-source infrastructure as code software tool created by HashiCorp. Terraform enables users to define and provision infrastructure using a high-level configuration language known as HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) or optionally JSON.

## About Terraform

Terraform provides a way to automate the creation, modification, and deletion of infrastructure resources such as virtual machines, networks, storage, and more across various cloud providers and on-premises environments. It follows a declarative syntax, allowing users to describe the desired state of their infrastructure in configuration files, which Terraform then interprets and executes to bring the infrastructure into the desired state.

## Repository Structure

In this repository, we'll explore Terraform from the ground up. Each module in this repository will cover different aspects of Terraform, including:

- Installation and Setup
- Basic Configuration
- Managing Infrastructure
- Terraform Modules
- Terraform Providers
- Best Practices
- and more!

Feel free to explore the modules in the repository and follow along as we dive deeper into Terraform.
